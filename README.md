# Library Management System for Rey Valley International School

Welcome to the Library Management System (LMS) designed specifically for Rey Valley International School. This system streamlines the process of tracking, issuing, searching, and returning books, ensuring a smooth and efficient library experience for both staff and students.

## Repository Information

The entire app, including all its files and resources, exists on a private repository. Due to the privacy and sensitivity of the data, this repository cannot be made public. The current repository you are viewing only contains the code files. The actual data for the library (books, users, etc.) is stored elsewhere and needs to be provided.

## Features

- **Book Tracking**: Easily keep track of all books, their current status, and their location.
- **Issuing & Returning**: Simplify the process of issuing books to students and receiving them back.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly search and locate books within the library's inventory.
- **User Management**: Manage user profiles, including students and staff, and their borrowing history.
